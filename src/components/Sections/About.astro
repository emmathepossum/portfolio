      Greetings Traveler! I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for
      building seamless, efficient applications and a growing interest in
      DevOps. Since 2017, I've mainly worked in the e-commerce sector, diving
      deep into the backend with over six years of PHP experience, and adding
      JavaScript and TypeScript to my toolkit over the last three years.
      Throughout my journey, I've worked on over 10 different online shops,
      creating custom solutions like product export tools for price comparison
      sites and ERP systems, as well as connecting Magento with Amazon and eBay.
      I've also had a blast working on full-stack apps, including digitizing
      paper job listings and developing an AI tool for SEO meta tag generation.
      Lately, I've been flexing my DevOps muscles, fine-tuning server
      infrastructures, migrating between cloud providers, and Dockerizing
      applications. I'm also big on streamlining workflows and have designed
      CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to keep things running smoothly.
