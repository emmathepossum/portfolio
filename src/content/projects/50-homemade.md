In this project, I served as the Lead Developer for a fabrics store, overseeing the migration from Magento 1 to Magento 2. This was a major update aimed at improving the store's performance, security, and scalability, and I played a central role in ensuring the transition was seamless. I worked closely with the customer to understand their specific business needs, developing custom solutions to optimize their operations and enhance the overall user experience.

Beyond the migration, I was responsible for guiding junior developers, mentoring them on best practices, and ensuring the team followed high-quality development standards. I provided hands-on training and support, helping them improve their technical skills and understanding of Magento.

Throughout the project, I balanced both the technical and business aspects, making sure the solutions I developed were aligned with the customerâ€™s goals and delivered real value. This experience reinforced my ability to lead development teams, solve complex business challenges, and drive successful project outcomes.
