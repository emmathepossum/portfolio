For this project, I developed an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the SEO capabilities of webshop products. The tool automatically generates SEO meta tags for product listings, transcribes and summarizes video content, and creates SEO-optimized descriptions, all aimed at improving search engine visibility and user engagement. 

I worked as both the Lead Developer and DevOps Engineer on this project, leveraging technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenAI to deliver a seamless, efficient solution. My role involved overseeing the full development lifecycle, from frontend development and integration with AI models to backend infrastructure management and deployment. Through this project, I helped streamline content creation for e-commerce platforms, significantly boosting their SEO performance.
