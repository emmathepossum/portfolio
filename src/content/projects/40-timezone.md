In this project, I worked as both the Lead Developer and DevOps Engineer for a fashion store, managing the migration of the site to a new hosting provider and developing a new infrastructure concept. The store was already running on Shopware 6, and my role involved ensuring the migration was smooth and seamless while also optimizing the infrastructure for better scalability and performance.

One of my key contributions was containerizing the application using Docker, which helped simplify deployment and improve the development workflow. This allowed us to create a more consistent and reliable environment across different stages of development, testing, and production.

In addition to the migration, I worked on expanding the custom ERP integration, ensuring that the store's backend systems were efficiently connected and streamlined. This involved developing new features and improving the overall integration, making it easier for the store to manage inventory, orders, and customer data.

Through this project, I helped modernize the store's infrastructure, improve operational efficiency, and ensure the platform was ready to scale with future growth.
