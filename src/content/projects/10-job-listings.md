In this project, I worked as a Fullstack Developer to digitize paper job listings and streamline the process for both customers and internal teams. The goal was to create an efficient system that could fetch, scan, and process job listings from newspapers, ultimately transferring the data to our customer’s system.

I was responsible for building a configurable fetch client using Laravel that would retrieve PDF job listings from various newspapers. Once fetched, the PDFs were processed using AWS OCR to extract the relevant data. After processing, the data was transferred to the customer’s system for further use.

Additionally, I integrated this solution into an existing Vue.js UI, developing a new interface to allow users to manually check, edit, and publish the listings as needed. The stack for this project included Laravel for the backend, Vue.js and Nuxt.js for the frontend, and TypeScript for added type safety. I also leveraged AWS services to handle the OCR scanning and cloud storage.

Throughout the project, I worked on both the frontend and backend to ensure a smooth, efficient workflow, and I made sure that the solution was scalable and adaptable to different customer needs.
